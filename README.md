# Personal-Portfolio
## Description
As a junior web developer, my motivation for this project was to gain hands-on experience in building a command-line application and to reinforce my knowledge of object-oriented programming in JavaScript. I saw this project as an opportunity to apply the concepts of inheritance and class structure to create a practical solution for managing a software engineering team. Additionally, the project's focus on test-driven development allowed me to practice writing and running tests to ensure the application's functionality, which is an essential skill for a developer.

To achieve the tasks in this project, I began by carefully reviewing the provided starter code and test cases. Understanding the requirements and the expected outcomes was crucial before I proceeded with any coding. I then created classes for each team member by extending the Employee class, implementing the required properties and methods for Manager, Engineer, and Intern. This process involved structuring the code to maintain a clean and modular design.

To gather information about the development team members, I used the Inquirer package to prompt the user for input in the command line. I created a menu-driven interface that allowed users to add team members, such as managers, engineers, and interns, and gather their respective details. This involved handling user input and dynamically creating objects based on the selected team member type.

Throughout this project, I learned the importance of effective code organization and modularization, as it greatly contributed to the maintainability and scalability of the application. Additionally, working with classes and inheritance reinforced my understanding of object-oriented programming principles in JavaScript. The use of tests to verify the correctness of the code also underscored the significance of thorough testing in software development, ensuring that the application works as expected and reducing the likelihood of bugs in the future. Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience in building a command-line application with a focus on object-oriented design and test-driven development.
